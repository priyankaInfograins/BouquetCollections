                                    <p>No one. Not a single creature to have walked this planet (or crawled). Time may have been created equal. But not Bouquet NFTs. Each NFT is uniquely hand-drawn and programmatically generated. We've created 327 unique traits â€“ including character, bouquet, color, function and more facets, to ensure that each piece is a distinct work of art.</p>
                                    <p>The supply of each NFT varies. There's also a selection of Super Rares. Will you be one of the lucky owners? Only time will tell.</p>
                                    <p>All Bouquet collections are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain and hosted on IPFS (see record & proof). To access members-only areas, Bouquet collection holders must sign into their Metamask Wallet.</p>
